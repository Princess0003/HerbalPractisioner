                    <h3>Nutritional Therapy</h3>
                    <p>Medication is not all about taking doses of drugs! Certain natural foods by virtue of their
                        intrinsic nutrients are powerful medicines. Thus, as a certified nutritionist, we also treat
                        health challenges by recommending / prescribing some natural foods as both meal and medicine to
                        patients. </p>
